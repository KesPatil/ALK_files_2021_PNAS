<p align="justify">
README: supporting data for 2021 manuscript PNAS Patil et. al. There are three folders F_unbiased that includes the files to setup and perform Unbiased Molecular Dynamics, F_metad contains files to setup and perform metadynamics, F_post_processing contains files to perform post processing <br />
</p>

## Folders
<p align="justify">
F_unbiased: This folder has the input gromacs .mdp scripts required to perform Unbiased Molecular Dynamics and the active and the inactive structures of ALK <br />
1. The equilibration and production procedure is as mentioned in the SI <br />
2. The outputs (.gro, .cpt, .top, .tpr) of the unbiased MD simualtion are inputs to Metadynamics. The active and inactive ALK structures at 101 ns of MD simulation were chosen as reference in the Metadynamics run. These structures are included in F_metad as  active_wt_alk_CA_meta_min.pdb and  inactive_wt_alk_CA_meta_min.pdb <br />

F_metad: This folder has the input scripts required to perform Metadynamics and also the output HILLS and free energy files <br />
1. plumed.dat - a plumed script that needs to be run for performing Metadynamcs <br />
2. active_wt_alk_CA_meta_min.pdb - the reference active structure, one of the two collective variables is RMSD from this structure <br />
3. inactive_wt_alk_CA_meta_min.pdb - the reference inactive structure, one of the two collective variables is RMSD from this structure <br />

PS note: Additionally, you would need the usual gromacs file:  .mdp file, .top file, .cpt file, .tpr file which are the outputs of unbiased MD <br />

4. HILLS  - We implement four walkers and hence have four HILLS files as output of metadynamics run which need to be read by sum_hills action of plumed that returns the free energy by summing of the gaussians that have been deposited <br />
5. fes_650.dat - The free energy file which has free energy at every coordinate on CV space. The reason this is named fes_650.dat, since each walker runs 650 ns, so the aggregate time that we have is 2.6us (4 walkers) <br />



F_post_processing: This folder contain the python scripts used for post-processing trajectories data to calculate hydrogen bond occupancies, plot free energy landscapes, and check convergence of metadynamics free energy zones  </br>

## Forcefield implemented

Our MD and metadynamics simulations use charmm27.ff from GROMACS 5.0.7

## Procedure
### 1. MD simulation in GROMACS <br />
<p align="justify">
The MD simulations are performed in GROMACS. The paper mentions Biophyscode which actually is a wrapper on Gromacs. Please feel free to try out Biophyscode, a creation from Radhakrishnan lab. https://biophyscode.github.io. Please note: Following is the walk-through on how to  run a simulation using Biophyscode:

"https://biophyscode.github.io/molecular_dynamics_lab/"


All the requisite files needed to setup and run the simulations are  included in the F_unbiased. We followed Bevan Lab Tutorials: "Lysozyme in water" example  <br />
http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html
</p>

### 2. Enhanced sampling simulation of Metadynamics using PLUMED <br />
<p align="justify">
We patch GROMACS 5.0.7 with PLUMED 2.3.5 and use multiple walker (num_of_walkers=4) metadynamics. For installation procedure of PLUMED and the subsequent patching with GROMACS, see here: https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.6/user-doc/html/_installation.html <br />
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the folder F_metad we have the scripts required to run the metadynamics. Please note: Metadynamics has to be run using the output .gro and .cpt files of the unbiased MD  simulations. The folder contains the .mdp file, plumed.dat and the reference active and inactive ALK alpha Carbons structure files <br />
</p>

<p align="justify">
plumed.dat metadynamics script is run in GROMACS 5.0.7 patched with PLUMED 2.3.5 using multiple walker (num_of_walkers=4) metadynamics. We set in the PLUMED script, the energy in kcal/mol and length in Å. The parameters used in this study to perform Well-Tempered multiple walker metadynamics (WTMD) are:bias factor γ = T +∆T/T = 20, height = 0.6 and pace = 500. <br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="justify">
Aggregate of 2.6us metadynamics run in GROMACS 5.0.7 patched with PLUMED 2.3.5 using multiple walker (num_of_walkers=4) metadynamics until the convergence criterion is met for the zones of interest (See section C1 in the SI of  Patil et. al. PNAS 2021<br />
</p>

<p align="justify">
The output of the metadynamics run are the HILLS files. We will have four of them since we used four walkers. To get the free energy file from the HILLS use <b>plumed sum_hills</b> action of PLUMED (https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.5/user-doc/html/sum_hills.html) <br />
</p>

### 3. Description of the post-processing codes <br />

Analysis of the trajectories was done using python and mostly MDanalysis package in python: https://www.mdanalysis.org  <br />

 The folder F_post_processing contains three codes: <br />
 <p align="justify">
 1. Free_energy_convergence.ipynb is the code to plot the free energy landscapes using fes.dat file and also to give the free energy estimate of the zone of interest using the equation 4 under section C1 in SI. <br />
 2. hbonds.py is the code that takes in trajectory files from the zones as input and outputs things required for the next code - plot_zone.py (to reproduce plots in Fig 3A and 3B in main text)  <br />
 3. plot_zone.py takes in the output from hbonds.py and reproduces the plots in Fig 3A and 3B in main text)  <br />
